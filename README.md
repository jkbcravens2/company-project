#The Company Project reinforces the use of Object Oriented Programming principles.
  * __Inheritance__ is demonstrated by the "is a " relationship between the Supervisor and Employee classes
  * __Abstraction__ is demonstrated in the Employee class. There is one basic constructor that obly takes in 
  the employee's name and social security number. This is for quick entry into the system. The user will
  then be able to update the employee's information with the second constructor which overloads the first.
  * __Encapsulation__ is shown in the three objects int he program. Each of them contain their own methods
  for printing, adding, removing, etc. These methods only need to be called in the main program, not written
  and rewritten.
